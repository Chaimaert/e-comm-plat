Nosa is a responsive full eccomerce platform.

This is a React application that uses the React Router library to handle client-side routing. It defines several routes for different pages of the application, such as the home page, 
about page, shop page, contact page, login page, signup page, forgot password page, cart page, checkout page, and product details page.

The App component is the main component that renders the application. It uses the BrowserRouter component to set up the routing system and the Routes component to define the different routes.

Each route is defined using the Route component, which takes a path prop and a element prop. The path prop specifies the URL path for the route, and the element prop specifies the 
component to render when the route is matched.

The ShopContext component is a custom context that is used to share data between different components in the application.
